# starterjs-ui

This simple JavaScript starket kit is written as an effort to minimize the frustration that I have to face almost every time I start a new project. 

## Who is it for?
Anyone who stumbles upon an idea and wants to make a quick prototype with a ready made development server using express and the latest ES features but perhaps wants to stick to vanilla JavaScript.
